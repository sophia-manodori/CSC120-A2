What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I think I found it difficult to think of objects in terms of classes as opposed to variables or lists or the things I worked with in 110. Overall, it was a really fun excersize even though I did get frusterated a few times. I think I got the handle of the functions quickly. What took more time was understanding how to reference a function and how to name things, and how to assign new values to various things inside the class. It was definitely an adjustment. 

I would tell people to be prepared to code in a completely different and more hands-off way. It requires a very different way of thinking and a very different way of organizing your thoughts. I would definitely recommend writing things out before starting a project!
